# Installation

Use the `install.sh` script to install all dot files, backing up any existing
ones first.

# Testing
I run tests before committing (hm, maybe that should be a hook) but you may run
`install.test.sh` to make sure all the files are sane. Tbh the tests failing
is a messier scenario than the install script failing

# Dependencies
Neovim config depends on elixerLS
zsh config depends on Powerlevel10k and oh-my-zsh
